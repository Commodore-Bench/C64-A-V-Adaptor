# C64-A-V-Adaptor
An A/V-adaptor board for the C64
This board is intended to connect to the Commodore C64 and use standard cables (audio, composite with RCA connector and/or s-video with a mini-DIN cable).

It also provides a 330Ohm connector, which attenuates the s-video chroma line. This resistor can be bridged with a jumper. 

Also an optional stereo output on pin 7 of the a/v jack (stereo sid, FPGA SID etc.) can be connected to the right audio channel. By default, this channel is also connected to the (mono) audio output.
